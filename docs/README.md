features:
- title: What is API3?
  details: API3 is a collaborative project to deliver traditional API services to smart contract platforms in a decentralized and trust-minimized way. It is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), its code is open source and its operations are transparent.
- title: API3 Thesis Statement
  details: The vast majority of the external integrations that decentralized applications need are to commercial Web APIs that traditional businesses have built to monetize their data and services. Therefore, what is widely known as the oracle problem is in practice the API connectivity problem. Existing oracle solutions fall short because they fail to make this distinction, resulting in inferior solutions that depend on third-party oracles and ecosystems that exclude API providers. By refining the definition of the problem, API3 aims to provide a much more optimal solution.
- title: Contributing (to the API3 DAO as a technical member)
  details: This is aimed to guide an API3 DAO member with a technical background to contribute to the project (through development, integrations, writing documentation, etc.) The general point is that one needs to be able to use a solution proficiently before being able to improve it. Therefore, you are recommended to do all of the below before attempting to contribute, and make sure to ask any questions you have on our Discord.
