`security.json` is the file the deployer uses to push API credentials along with the serverless function.

::: danger TODO
The two fields mentioned are not in the code sample below but are in the one below the first.
This page needs work with some details about security.
:::

## Fields

Has two fields:

* `apiCredentials`: Keeps the values of the security scheme parameters and the necessary fields to identify them
* `id`: A UUID for the specific `config.json` file and its corresponding `security.json` file

### `apiCredentials`

An example:

```javascript
{
  "myOisTitle": [
    {
      "securitySchemeName": "mySecurityScheme",
      "value": "mysupersecretkey"
    }
  ]
}
```

## The user flow

Here is an example `security.json` file that is generated by a third party \(e.g., an integration platform\):

```javascript
{
  "apiCredentials": {
    "myOisTitle": [
      {
        "securitySchemeName": "mySecurityScheme",
        "value": "<TO_BE_FILLED>"
      }
    ]
  },
  "id": "9a52131e-babd-11ea-b3de-0242ac130004"
}
```

The first option here is for the user to open `security.json` and replace `<TO_BE_FILLED>` with their API key. Alternatively, the user may directly attempt to deploy with `security.json` and the corresponding `config.json` \(which has the same `id`\), where the deployment script parses `security.json` and asks for the user to provide the values of each of the security credentials \(this is not implemented yet, see the [related issue](https://github.com/api3dao/airnode/issues/163)\).
